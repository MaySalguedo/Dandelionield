# Dandelionield - Java Learning Project

A comprehensive Java project developed throughout an academic semester, implementing various computer science concepts using Apache Ant as the build system. This project represents my early programming journey and includes multiple domains of study.

## Project Overview

This repository contains a multi-module Java application exploring fundamental algorithms, data structures, mathematics, physics simulations, and basic graphical interfaces. Built with Apache Ant, it serves as a cumulative demonstration of semester-learned concepts, including early code with acknowledged anti-patterns and improvements over time.

**Disclaimer:** This project contains code written during my initial learning phase. Some sections exhibit suboptimal practices (tight coupling, limited error handling, inconsistent patterns) that reflect my growth throughout the development cycle.
